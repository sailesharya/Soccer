AddLeagueFormServlet includes a single initialisation parameter called seasons-list with value "Spring,Summer,Autumn,Winter".
This configuration object is passed to the servlet instance by way of the init method, which is sent by the web container.

AddLeagueFormServlet can be used to create a form that is dynamically configured. It uses ServletConfig object
to retrieve the seasons list.


index.jsp > add_league.jsp > AddLeagueServlet > ErrorPageServlet or SuccessServlet
    Here if error is produced while filling the form the errors are displayed in another page(,i.e, ErrorPageServlet).
    AddLeagueServlet forwards to ErrorPageServlet using RequestDispatcher.
    

index.jsp > AddLeagueFormServlet > AddLeague2Servlet > AddLeagueFormServlet or SuccessServlet
    Here if error is produced while filling the form the errors are displayed in same page as the form(,i.e, AddLeagueFormServlet).
    AddLeagueServlet forwards back to AddLeagueFormServlet using RequestDispatcher if any error is encountered.
    Here AddLeagueFormServlet is a dynamically configured form using params in web.xml
    
index.jsp > ListLeaguesServlet
    Displays the list of leagues.
    
    
Sharing Application Resources using ServletContext::
        To create a shared list of leagues, the soccer application uses an attribute called leagueList.AddLeagueServlet and
        ListLeaguesServlet use context object to gain access to the leagueList attribute.
            The following tasks need to be performed to initialize the leaguelist context-scope attribute :
        1> Determine location of leagues.txt file.
        2> Read the leagues.txt file.
        3> Create League object for each row in the leagues.txt file and store them in a List object.
        4> Store the list of leagues in the leaguelist context attribute.
        
        The soccer application uses a context listener called InitializeLeagues. The InitializeLeagues listener implements the
        contextInitialized method to read the list of leagues from a flat file, which is file resource in web application.
        The leagues.txt file is stored in WEB-INF/data/leagues.txt.
